These elements are web components implementing extremely common general-purpose
user interface patterns. They are all designed to satisfy the Gold Standard
checklist for Web Components, and so are intended to be immediately useful in
your web projects.

See the [documentation](https://elix.org/documentation/elements) for more
details about each element, including live demos.

Since no solution is perfect for everyone, all of these elements are built from
[mixins](https://elix.org/documentation/mixins) that you can recombine to suit
your needs. In that case, you may find these elements helpful as reference
examples.
