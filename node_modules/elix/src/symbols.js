/**
 * Collection of shared Symbol objects for internal component communication.
 * 
 * The shared `Symbol` objects in this module let mixins and a component
 * internally communicate without exposing these properties and methods in the
 * component's public API. They also help avoid unintentional name collisions,
 * as a component developer must specifically import the `symbols` module and
 * reference one of its symbols.
 *
 * To use these `Symbol` objects in your own component, include this module and
 * then create a property or method whose key is the desired Symbol. E.g.,
 * [ShadowTemplateMixin](ShadowTemplateMixin) expects a component to define
 * a property called [symbols.template](#template):
 *
 *     import * as template from 'elix/src/template.js'
 *     import * as symbols from 'elix/src/symbols.js';
 *     import ShadowTemplateMixin from 'elix/src/ShadowTemplateMixin.js';
 * 
 *     class MyElement extends ShadowTemplateMixin(HTMLElement) {
 *       [symbols.template]() {
 *         return template.html`Hello, <em>world</em>.`;
 *       }
 *     }
 * 
 * The above use of `symbols.template` lets the mixin find the component's
 * template in a way that will not pollute the component's public API or
 * interfere with other component logic. For example, if for some reason the
 * component wants to define a separate property with the plain string name,
 * "template", it can do so without affecting the above property setter.
 * 
 * While this project generally uses `Symbol` objects to hide component
 * internals, Elix does make some exceptions for methods or properties that are
 * very helpful to have handy during debugging. E.g.,
 * [ReactiveMixin](ReactiveMixin) exposes its [setState](ReactiveMixin#setState)
 * method publicly, even though invoking that method from outside a component is
 * generally bad practice. The mixin exposes `setState` because it's very useful
 * to have access to that in a debug console.

/**
 * Symbol for the `raiseChangeEvents` property.
 *
 * This property is used by mixins to determine whether they should raise

 * events in response to direct user interactions. For a detailed discussion
 * of this point, see the Gold Standard checklist item for
 * [Propery Change Events](https://github.com/webcomponents/gold-standard/wiki/Property%20Change%20Events).
 *
 * The above article describes a pattern for using a flag to track whether
 * work is being performed in response to internal component activity, and
 * whether the component should therefore raise property change events.
 * This `raiseChangeEvents` symbol is a shared flag used for that purpose by
 * all Elix mixins and components. Sharing this flag ensures that internal
 * activity (e.g., a UI event listener) in one mixin can signal other mixins
 * handling affected properties to raise change events.
 *
 * All UI event listeners (and other forms of internal handlers, such as
 * timeouts and async network handlers) should set `raiseChangeEvents` to
 * `true` at the start of the event handler, then `false` at the end:
 *
 *     this.addEventListener('click', event => {
 *       this[symbols.raiseChangeEvents] = true;
 *       // Do work here, possibly setting properties, like:
 *       this.foo = 'Hello';
 *       this[symbols.raiseChangeEvents] = false;
 *     });
 *
 * Elsewhere, property setters that raise change events should only do so it
 * this property is `true`:
 *
 *     set foo(value) {
 *       // Save foo value here, do any other work.
 *       if (this[symbols.raiseChangeEvents]) {
 *         export const event = new CustomEvent('foo-changed');
 *         this.dispatchEvent(event);
 *       }
 *     }
 *
 * In this way, programmatic attempts to set the `foo` property will not
 * trigger the `foo-changed` event, but UI interactions that update that
 * property will cause those events to be raised.
