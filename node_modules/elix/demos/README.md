This package contains stylesheets and other resources used by demos in the Elix
elements. These demos are viewable at https://elix.org, both inline in the
[documentation](https://component.kitchen/elix) and also available directly.
You can view the ListBox demo in listBox.html at
https://component.kitchen/demos/listBox.html.

Because these demos are used in two different contexts (standalone, and in situ on documentation pages), the HTML for demo pages should:

* Include a div defined by `<div class="demo">`.

* Avoid empty lines in the HTML source inside the demo. Blank lines can confuse the syntax highlighting used on documentation pages.
